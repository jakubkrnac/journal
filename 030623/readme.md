# Wokring on baskets

Today we have continued working on our prototypes of the shopping baskets. As mentioned in the [last entry](https://github.com/jakubkrnac/journal/030323) I was working on a basket that will give feedback in a form of haptics. Our group is trying to find which form of feedback is the most fitting to our application.
I have used a little vibrating motor which I have borrowed from th IOIO lab along with an [ESP32 S2 Mini development board](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html).
